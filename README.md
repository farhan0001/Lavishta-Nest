# Lavishta Nest - E-commerce Website - MERN Stack

## Overview
This project is a full-featured **E-commerce Website** developed using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). It includes a secure authentication system using **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and role-based authorization for admin and user access. The application uses **Redux** for state management, providing a centralized store to handle user sessions, products, and cart functionality efficiently.
